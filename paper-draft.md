# Participation Rates Explain Top-Level Group Disparities: Why Women Are Not Worse Than Men at Chess

## Abstract

It is commonly argued that there exist inherent differences between men and women when it comes to chess
performance. A piece of evidence frequently cited is the disproportionate
ratio of males to females at elite competition levels (approx. 45) vs lower levels (approx. 10).

In this paper, I use a novel variant of extreme value theory (EVT) to challenge the idea that these
ratios prove innate differences between men and women. A
summary of the methods:

1. Acquire a distribution of active chess players from the general population
2. Using the active player distribution, predict the male and female distributions for FIDE-rated
   chess players, and predict the expected gender composition.
3. Using the FIDE-rated distribution, predict distributions and gender compositions among top
player subpopulations, such as Grandmasters (GMs), those rated over 2400, and the top 1000
players.

These predictions exhibited remarkable accuracy, showing that top-level gender imbalances in
chess can be fully explained by participation rate.

In addition, this method of analysis is generalizable to any rankable activity where one
subpopulation drastically outnumbers the other at extreme levels of competition.

## Introduction

This apparent disparity also supports the
controversial variance hypothesis, which suggests higher variability in various domains for
males, such as intelligence.

For this analysis, I utilized data from 2020. The only data points used for prediction
are:

1. Active chess players in the general population (approximately 15%)
2. Percentage of female chess players participants (around 8.2% to 10.1%)
3. Total sizes of subpopulations without prior knowledge about their gender ratios (e.g., 1725
   GMs).
